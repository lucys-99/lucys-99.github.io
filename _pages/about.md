Hi, I'm [Zhuoran Sun (Lucy)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhuoran-sun-37a345162), a Master's student in Computational Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I hold a bachelor's degree in Business Administration and a joint major in Mathematics and Computer Science from Emory University.

## Experiences

I am passionate about applying data science methods across diverse industries and fields, with a particular focus on business, finance, and time-series analysis. During my time at Emory University, I contributed to academic research as a Research Assistant, where I analyzed large-scale e-commerce datasets to improve recommendation algorithms and gain insights into customer behavior.

Prior to pursuing my Masterâ€™s at Carnegie Mellon University, I worked as a Quantitative Research Analyst at Truist Securities, specializing in fixed-income businesses. My role involved automating financial reporting processes, optimizing SQL queries to enhance data efficiency, and developing advanced tools for bond pricing and data manipulation. These projects leveraged my expertise in Python, Snowflake, and SQL to deliver impactful solutions for trading and research teams.

In addition to my data science experience, I enjoy designing and developing websites to improve business operations and streamline workflows. For example, I built an internal sales management platform for the Emory Wheel sales group, using Django as the backend framework. This system enabled the team to effectively track client interactions, manage inventory, and generate detailed sales reports, significantly improving operational efficiency and communication within the team.
